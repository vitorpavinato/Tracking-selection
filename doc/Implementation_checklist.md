## **FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS**

**Priorities**
- Sample theta and Ne from prior: sample theta and use it to define the population size for M-D equilibrium, then change the population size to the sampled Ne;
- Work on the SLiM code to allow the simulation of Ne where Ne < ns;
- Redifine genome architecture.
