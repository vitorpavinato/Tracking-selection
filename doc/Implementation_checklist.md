## **FUTURE IMPLEMENTATIONS**

**Priorities**
- fix the time for first sample - Time of equilibrium teq = t1: [done]
- Implement the hitchhiking influence on neutral markers:
- Implement the proportion of SNPs as adaptive - taken from the prior: [done]
- Implement the proportion of fragments (g1 and g2 elements) with adaptive SNPs - prior:
- remove SNPs with MAF < 0.05 during data conversion:
- Implement this simulation values on the lss and gss reference table:

**List of the last implementations
- Sample theta and Ne from prior: sample theta and use it to define the population size for M-D equilibrium - Ne0, then change the population size to Ne1: done
- Work on the SLiM code to allow the simulation of Ne where Ne < ns: done
- Redifine genome architecture: done
