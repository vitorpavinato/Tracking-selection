###### Pipeline:
1. Incorporate the last pipeline bug fix implemented - for this use the T.Devil or bees pipeline as "backbone";

###### SLiM script:
1. Change the event for the upload of the .tree file in period 2 - from early() to late(),
	- and, Add one more generation after the upload of the .tree file (see the script for bees);
2. Change calculation of genetic load (see calculation used for bees data);
